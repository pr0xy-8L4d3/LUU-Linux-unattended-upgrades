# LUU - Linux unattended upgrades with email notification

Since I am having so many linux virtual machines, servers and containers I really don't have time for updating each on regular basis.
For that reason I am using automatic upgrades. And I really want to be notified about each upgrade.
Due to it is time consuming to install unattended upgrades and ssmtp, I created this script which install and tweek all needed configurations. Yeah I know, I am lazy ;).

Notes:
- <s>currently sending emails only works with gmail account</s>
- if you are using gmail, you need to enable less secure apps to access gmail account

How it works. Just run the script and follow installation guides.
