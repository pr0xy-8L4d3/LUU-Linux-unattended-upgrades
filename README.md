# LUU - Linux unattended upgrades with gmail notification

Since I am having so many linux virtual machines, servers and containers I really don't have time for updating each on regular basis.
For that reason I am using automatic upgrades. And I really want to be notified about each upgrade.
Due to it is time consuming to install unattended upgrades and ssmtp, I created this script which install and tweek all needed configurations. Yeah I know, I am lazy ;).

Notes:
- currently sending emails only works with gmail account
- you need to enable less secure apps to access gmail account

How it works. Just run the script and follow installation guides.
